# GraggGPU

This project is an implementation of the Gragg algorithm for finding eigen values of "arrow" matrixes on GPU.

The mathematics details are to be found in the paper Borg√®s and Gragg - 1993 which is in the /Papers section of this repository. 
We only implement what is described in the section 3 of this paper.
